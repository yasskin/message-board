Question and Answer Message Board
Create a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers.

Questions should have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes.
Answers should have the content of the answer and the author.
Include a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.
List all questions on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing.
Users should be able to click on a question to view additional information.
Allow users to add and edit questions.
Allow users to add answers to a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
Important note: While we have not yet encountered it during our course, there is currently a known issue in EmberFire that may temporarily display duplicate child data. You can refresh the browser and the duplication should be gone. Only a single entry will actually be written to Firebase. Any instances of this bug will not count against your code review.

Further Exploration
If you have completed the objectives for the code review, consider adding some additional features:

Add custom styling.
Implement upvote/downvote functionality so that users may vote on answers.
Add tags to questions.
Objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:
